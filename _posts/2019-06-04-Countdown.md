<center><b>Countdown</b> is a simulation of the TV show Countdown</center>
     
 This is my very first project I have designed. It is based off the maths section of Countdown. If you like this game, please give a **star** for motivation, It makes me happy.

## About

Countdown is my very first project I have decided to make. I am still working on it, it is currently only using PHP. I do intend to integrate Javascript into it as well.

Feel free to play around with it and do your own editing of the game if you'd like to!
