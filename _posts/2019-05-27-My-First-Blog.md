## Who Am I

Hi, my name is Alex Pham and I currently am a 2nd year student at the Univeristy of New South Wales. I am studying a double degree of Bachelor of Computer Science and Bachelor of Commerce (Finance).

## What is this

I have set up my own portfolio website to display my current projects and any future ones. The posts I will create will entail my thought processes of developing these projects, for example what methods I used, how many hours I put in and many more. I hope by doing this, it will show any other students the reality of making your own project and how enjoyable and challenging it can be. As well as this, I want to be able to show you my own mindset and how I think so that you can see what it's like in the head of a uni student.

I also hope to post anything I learn from university and work and how I plan on utilising the new found knowledge.
